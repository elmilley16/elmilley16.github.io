# realty-site-mockup
Real Estate Agency mockup website (WIP)
https://elmilley16.github.io/

To increase accessibility, I've included the following in my code:
- 'hidden links': this allows users that need a screen reader or keyboard to navigate instead of a mouse to quickly tab to various sections of the website and skip to the main content. Simply hit tab when immediately getting on the website
- aria attributes
- aria labels
